Explanation:
Dependencies: We installed inquirer for handling interactive prompts and @types/inquirer for TypeScript type definitions.

tsconfig.json: This file specifies the TypeScript compiler options. We've configured it to target ES5 and output the compiled JavaScript files to the dist directory.

index.ts: This is where our CLI application logic resides. We import inquirer, define a function main() that prompts the user for their name and a color choice using inquirer.prompt(), and then logs the inputted values.

main() Function: We use async/await to handle the asynchrony of inquirer.prompt(). It waits for the user's input, which is then stored in the answers object.

Running the Application: After compiling the TypeScript code, we can run the resulting JavaScript file (dist/index.js) using Node.js.
